TIFU by sleeping though my mom’s birthday
So today I f***ed up. M18
Friday night I went to a friend’s house and we were with 8 people (still in guidelines with a MAX of 10) and we had a fun but very late night. We all fell asleep at around 7AM Saturday. and we woke up at about 9AM
So when I arrived home I did what my mom asked of me and after that I prepared my tasks for school, but after about an hour I really started to feel that I was exhausted, so I lied down in my bed. Around 5PM. And about an hour later my brother, my sister and her BF showed up because we had a large family dinner, that nobody told me about ( I should’ve known since it was my mom’s birthday .
And she texted me on my phone to join dinner, but I was asleep. And usually when I don’t answer it’s cause I’m listening music or gaming, so she comes up to my room to check on me and get me for dinner. But that night she didn’t come get me. And that’s fair because I turned 18 and I am not a little child anymore.
So I made this Reddit post to ask anyone, seriously just anyone “what can I do” I genuinely feel terrible for missing out on het birthday dinner and I don’t know how to make it up. I have a really good connection with my mom and I know that in about a week or so she will have forgiven me.
But I feel like I need to do something just because I feel bad about it. What can I do other than say I’m sorry.
